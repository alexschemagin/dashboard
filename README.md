Touch-friendly Dashboard UI
===========================

This code will evolve over time to support improved design and added features. It utilizes [flickity.js](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity) for a smooth scrolling functionality and is intended for touch screen inputs. The native and responsive ``` onTouch ``` and ``` onScroll ``` scrollable area will serve as a dock of items. Each will be clickable and will open in an overlay animation.
